International Metrology Resource Registry
===========================

Access to scientific data and resources across the global community is limited and fragmented. Local resource providers are frequently populated with new resources but the larger community is often unaware that these potentially interesting resources are available. The International Metrology Resource Registry (IMRR) bridges the gap between existing resources and the end users by registering the resources and their metadata for search and discovery. 

Resource providers would use the IMRR software to register their resources' descriptive metadata, access, and communication protocol for search and retrieval. The IMRR software, functioning as a comprehensively located service, would then make the registered information available for lookup to the global community.

The IMRR software was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
